Would you like some help with your research?
Here is a collection of cool resources, websites and software to get you started!
They can be useful to anyone, including students at all levels, academic researchers, and scientists in other institutions.

This is meant to be a collaborative endeavor, so if you have things to add, you're more than welcome to contribute by <a href="mailto:guillaume.dalle@epfl.ch?subject=contributing to PhD Resources">sending me an email</a> or filing an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phd-resources/phd-resources.github.io).

> Warning: I have not tested all of these tools myself, so be sure to check that they are safe and up-to-date before using them.

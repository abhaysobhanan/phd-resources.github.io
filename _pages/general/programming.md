## Learning to program

- [Computer Science Education](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science): Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science
- [Data Science Education](https://github.com/ossu/data-science): Path to a free self-taught education in Data Science
- [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/): Novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): Find the best answer to your technical question, help others answer theirs.
- [NoCode](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode): The best way to write secure and reliable applications.

## Good practices

- [The Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/): An open source collaborative guide to make sure that the projects you work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): A general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citeable.
- [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/): Highlights trending Machine Learning research and the code to implement it.
- [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/): An open source license protects contributors and users. Businesses and savvy developers wonâ€™t touch a project without this protection.

## Development tools

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A source-code editor made by Microsoft, ranked the most popular developer environment tool in 2022.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): A distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): An Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.

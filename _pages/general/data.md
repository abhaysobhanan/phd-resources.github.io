## Good practices

- [The Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/): An open source collaborative guide to make sure that the projects you work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): A general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citeable.

## Qualitative

- [QualCoder](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder): Qualitative data analysis for text, images, audio, video.
- [NVivo](https://ritme.com/en/software/nvivo/): A qualitative data analysis software designed to help researchers collect and organize data.

## Geography

- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/):  Create, edit, visualise, analyse and publish geospatial information.
